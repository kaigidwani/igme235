        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Starfield is a singleplayer role-playing game set in space from the creators of the Elder Scrolls and
            Fallout. It is their first new IP in 25 years.
            In Starfield, you create your own character and tell their story with an adventure through the entire wide
            universe that you get to explore.

        <h2>Quote</h2>
        <blockquote>
            Starfield, as with Bethesda's previous work, requires its player to submit to the spell that is being cast.
            The rewards for those who can overlook the often awkward delivery of dialogue, bodies that glitch through
            scenery,
            the confusion of menus and the flimsy feel of combat are considerable. Because that feeling of electric
            possibility
            – when the horn section swells as you touch down on a new planet, stride into the nearest settlement, then
            pick up whatever threads of story interest you – never wanes.
