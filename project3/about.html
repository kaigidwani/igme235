    <h2>Jumprope</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Pitch: My game is a jumprope challenge reflex game where you try to make your character jump over the incoming rope as many times as you can while it gets progressively faster.
        </li>
        <li>
            Genre: Arcade
        </li>
        <li>
            Platform: Desktop
        </li>
        <li>
            Aesthetics: Simple, monochrome background and jumprope. The player character will be blue for visual draw and emphasis by standing out. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Gameplay: The players will be able to press the spacebar to make their character jump. If they do it at the right time they will clear the jumprope.
